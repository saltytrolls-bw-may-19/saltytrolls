## Customer Spec

Pitch: Build an app that uses Hacker News comment data to rank commenters based on negative comment sentiment (saltiness).

MVP: App rates and ranks hacker news commenters by negativity of comment sentiment (limited to commenters who have made x number of posts). Allows users to search by username to view comments and sentiment levels of specific users.

Stretch Goal: App also displays the sentiment of individual comments by user allowing drilldown to a user view.

## ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES

Here is where I would like each teams required environment variables stored. Since we all work on this file, I want you to clone it. Then right before you add a variable it want you to run `get pull` in this repo, to make sure you are not deleting eachothers on your local machine. Then add the variable you need, `git commit` and `git push` right away. These will go directly to master

If the environment variable is something private just enter the `NAME=` and then include a link on the next line where the user can sign up for that key. Remember to keep all secrets secret.
