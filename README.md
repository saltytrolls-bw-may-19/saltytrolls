## Customer Spec

Pitch: Build an app that uses Hacker News comment data to rank commenters based on negative comment sentiment (saltiness).

MVP: App rates and ranks hacker news commenters by negativity of comment sentiment (limited to commenters who have made x number of posts). Allows users to search by username to view comments and sentiment levels of specific users.

Stretch Goal: App also displays the sentiment of individual comments by user allowing drilldown to a user view.
