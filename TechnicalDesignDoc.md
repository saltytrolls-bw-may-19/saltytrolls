Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- What is the mission statement?

Moderator management. Find negative users in the community easily.
Entertainment value.

Here at Salty Trolls we...

Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Rates and ranks hacker news commenters by negativity of comment sentiment

Allows users to search by username to view comments and sentiment of requested users

Front end landing page by UI team

React app with login

Backend with AI sentiment processing and login

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

Random humurous endpoint to display a random funny comment before login?

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

Not much competition that we found...except the other team.



Frameworks

- What 3rd party frameworks are you considering using?

BigQuery API for python

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

No but they made mention that we need to fork our own copy

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

Not as far as I know. If we do I found a sqlite datadump that we can convert into any free service
if necessary.

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
No apple developers on the team currently, we will try to stick to the frameworks taught in the last 5 weeks.

For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 


- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.


- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)



- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Forum modererators, curious individuals, trolled commentors

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

- Research thouroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
